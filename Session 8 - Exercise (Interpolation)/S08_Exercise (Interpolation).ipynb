    "# 8. Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you haven't already installed the packages `numpy`, `pandas`, `xlrd` and `scipy`, please do so.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This session has no new material per se. It's supposed to combine elements from the previous sessions into a larger exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is about 3D interpolation. A set of known points $(x_{known}, x_{known}, z_{known})$ have prescribed values and are used as basis for interpolating $z$-values for a large set of points where only $(x, y)$ are known.\n",
    "\n",
    "For performing the actual interpolation, we call a function from a third party library called `scipy`. It's built on top of of `numpy` and holds many operations used in scientific analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code originates from a COWI project where the points $(x, y)$ represent node coordinates from a base slab in a Finite Element model, while $z$-coordinates denote settlement values. The known points $(x_{known}, y_{known}, z_{known})$ stem from a detailed geotechnical analysis which could only be performed in a certain amount of points. The settlement values in the remaining points $(x, y)$ were therefore put into the FE-model as imposed displacements by a procedure similar to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 1.1\n",
    "Read through the code given in the script below and try to understand what it does and how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the script to your editor and run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add print statements if you are unsure about how a certain variable looks at any point throughout the code. Remember you can print the first five rows of a DataFrame with `df.head()`.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The script reads two Excel files, i.e. one containing known points and one containing points to be interpolated. \n",
    "One limitation of Excel files is that they cannot be read while they are open. If you want to inspect these files while running the script, create a copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 1.2\n",
    "The bulk of the computational work in the script is done by the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "```python\n",
    "settlements_interpolated = griddata(xy_known, settlements_known, (x_nodes, y_nodes), method='cubic')\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "This is the `scipy` function that performs the interpolation. Try to read the documentation for it [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned value that we save in the variable `settlements_interpolated` is a numpy array. You can see this by `print(type(settlements_interpolated))` which returns: `<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of the given code creates a figure object and an axis object which enables 3D plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue the plotting code to add:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D scatter plot of the known points $(x_{known}, y_{known}, z_{known})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3D scatter plot of the interpolated points $(x, y, z)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots should all be in the same figure and axis. Adding a scatter plot to an axis `ax` can be done as `ax.scatter(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, this was used in a project for interpolating settlement values to be applied in an FE-model. The FE-software (Sofistik) has a certain input language which the interpolated values needed to be blended into. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will construct the input `.dat`.file that Sofistik can read. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note:** This procedure could be used to produce many file types. It's a good way to programmatically create input files to software. This is just one specific example of a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sofistik input file we want to create has this syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "<pre><code>\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to write to files\n",
    "To write data to a file we can use something called a **context manager**. Basically, it allows us to open a file and write to it. See code snippet below:\n",

    "    file.write(\"This text will be written inside 'file_name.dat'\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "---\n",
