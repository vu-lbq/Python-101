    "#### Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries have key/value pairs which are enclosed in curly brackets`{}`. A value can be fetched by querying the corresponding key. Refering the data via logically named keys instead of list indexes makes the code more readable.\n",

    "    \n",
    "<code> d = {key1: value1, key2: value2, ..., key_n: value_n} </code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that values can be of any data type like floats, strings etc., but they can also be lists or other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys must be unique within the dictionary**. Otherwise it would be hard to extract the value by calling out a certain key, see the section about indexing and slicing below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys also must be of an immutable type.\n",
