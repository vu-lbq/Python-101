    "# Exercise 6B\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of exercise deals with post-processing of results from structural elements of Plaxis FE geotechnical calculation. The output is bending moment in plate elements and we will filter the results and plot each Construction Stage with its values into one figure per Stage for each plate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the purpose of this exercise, we are only extracting the bending moment data for illustration; the idea could be extended to any other results anyone would like to extract. Also, for simplicity, we are dealing with txt data files from Plaxis output; the process of extracting the data into the txt files (which takes quite some time to do) can be skipped by directly connecting Plaxis to Python (see https://www.plaxis.com/support/python-scripts/scripting-reference-and-how-to-use-it/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is shown in the first figure below. It has two plate elements of the retaining wall, namely \"Plate1\" and \"Plate2\" which extend vertically from the ground level to the toe level.\n",
    "Note that each plate element consists of multiple smaller plate elements when being modelled inside the FE program.\n",
    "(e.g. Plate\\_1\\_2 & Plate\\_1\\_1: plate 1 with sub-element 1 and sub-element 2 respectively)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the bending moment of these beam elements that we will work with and plot to see how they vary across the walls in each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Exercise 6B Data/Misc/Cross_Section_Sketch.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this plotting procedure is to give a quick overview of the results after a calculation has finished, and to be able to flip through the Construction Stages to easily compare them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 19 Construction Stages in the dataset, 2 different types of outputs and 2 different plate elements, resulting in 76 plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each plot will look something like this, which shows the forces in Plate_1 for Construction Stage in phase 9: \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Understanding the structural/geotechnical context of the dataset is not important for solving the exercise. The idea of the exercise here is to familiarize yourself with data processing and visualization using Python. The same concepts could be used for all other types of datasets. If you will, you can look at it as generic data which is to be filtered and plotted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "All data files are saved in the folder 'Exercise 6B Data/Input Data'. For each construction stage and each type of result, there is a separate txt file (e.g. Phase 2_Table of total displacement.txt, Phase 2_Table of plate force envelopes.txt, etc.). Make sure to download all the datasets and save it in a folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercise\n",
    "The general structure of the script is given below and provides the basis for the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Many lines of code from the original script have been removed and the exercise consists of filling them in again.***\n",
    "\n",
    "All code comments from the original script have been retained as guidance through the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is partly about reading and understanding already written code and partly about writing code yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading other people's code plays a big role when collaboration on programming projects, and it's sometimes harder than writing the code yourself. Thus, it's a good exercise to get some exposure to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, open some of the dataset files in the Input Data folder. Take a brief look at the contents of the file to get a feel for what you are working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy this directly into your editor to use as a guide through the exercise. "
